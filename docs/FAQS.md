<!--# Testrunner Toolkit FAQs-->

Below are list of frequently asked questions regarding some of the business and technical use cases surrounding the Testrunner Toolkit.

## Who is the Cypress beta for? 
The Cypress beta is for both Sauce Labs customers and prospects who have expressed interest in the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit and our Cypress testing support. 

## As a customer, is it free to try out? 
Any Sauce Labs customer in the beta will be able to run tests in parallel using their existing account. If you have a plan for 10 concurrent tests, then this will be the maximum concurrency you can use in this beta. If you need your account adjusted to try out this solution or want it extended to include new teams, please reach out to your account team.

## My free trial has expired, can it be extended? 
Definitely, if you’re on a trial account, send us an email at `beta+stt@saucelabs.com` and we’ll extend your trial so you can test out this new solution. 

## What’s next?
Let us know what’s missing! The team will listen to Cypress beta feedback and also be adding support for Playwright and TestCafe. Also on the roadmap is container support on Sauce Labs cloud. 

## How do I give feedback?
If you have questions or support requests, please email us at `beta+stt@saucelabs.com`. If you have feature requests, please log them to our GitHub project at https://github.com/saucelabs/testrunner-toolkit.
