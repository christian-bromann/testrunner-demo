title: Configuring the Testrunner Toolkit
sidebar_label: Configuration
---

The Testrunner Toolkit requires a configuration file to know which tests to run, along with which framework to use.

## Basic Configuration

By default, `config.yml` is the file [`saucectl`](saucectl) looks to for its configuration.

```yaml
#Simple config.yml using puppeteer
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: Feature XYZ
  tags:
    - e2e
    - release team
    - other tag
  build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
files:
  - ./tests/**/*.js
image:
  base: saucelabs/stt-puppeteer-jest-node
  version: v0.1.2
sauce:
  region: us-west-1
```

If you wish to use more than one framework, or to configure different sets of tests separately, you can use any name for the configuration file and specify it with the following command:

```bash
saucectl run -c ./path/to/config.yml
```

## Configuration Examples
Below are framework-specific configuration examples that exist in the [Testrunner Toolkit repository](https://github.com/saucelabs/testrunner-toolkit/tree/master/.sauce). The repository uses these configurations for its pipeline:

>
> **NOTE:** The test files need to match `(spec|test)` in their file name so they are automatically detected as `testfiles`.

  region: us-west-1
## Tunnel allows you to specify an existing sauce connect tunnel when running cypress inside the Sauce cloud.
## This has no effect when running tests inside docker.
#  tunnel:
#    id: your_tunnel_id
#    parent: parent_owner_of_tunnel # if applicable, specify the owner of the tunnel

```

<!--END_DOCUSAURUS_CODE_TABS-->

## Selecting the Test Environment
Saucectl supports two test environments. Docker and the Sauce Cloud.
Docker is the default test environment.

Use the CLI flag `--test-env` to specify where to run your tests.

For example, to run your tests in the Sauce Cloud:
```shell
saucectl run --test-env sauce --ccy 5
```

When using the Sauce Cloud, you can also control how many suites should run in concurrently via the `--ccy` flag.
Alternatively, you can also set it in the config (CLI flags take precedence):
```yaml
sauce:
  region: us-west-1
  concurrency: 5
```

Keep in mind that your configured concurrency cannot exceed the available concurrency of your Sauce Labs account.

> **NOTE:** For now, cypress is the only framework that supports the Sauce Cloud environment. All other frameworks run only inside docker.

## Cross Browser Tests
If you wish to execute tests on different browsers while using Testrunner Toolkit, add the `suites` parameter to your `.sauce/config.yml`:

```yaml
suites:
  - name: "chrome"
    match: ".*.(spec|test).js$"
    settings:
      browserName: "chrome"
  - name: "firefox"
    match: ".*.(spec|test).js$"
    settings:
      browserName: "firefox"
```

## Set different screen resolutions
If you wish to execute tests on different screen resolutions while using Testrunner Toolkit, add the `screenResolution` parameter to your `.sauce/config.yml`:

### Example

kind: cypress
sauce:
  region: us-west-1

    name: Testing Cypress Support

      - other tag
    build: Release $CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA

#  image: saucelabs/stt-cypress-mocha-node:v5.6.0

cypress:
  version: 5.6.0
  configFile: "tests/e2e/cypress.json"  # We determine related files based on the location of the config file.
suites:
  - name: "saucy test"
    browser: "chrome"
    platformName: "Windows 10"
    screenResolution: "1920x1080"  # Available resolutions on Windows: '800x600', '1024x768', '1152x864', '1280x768', '1280x800', '1280x960', '1280x1024', '1400x1050', '1440x900', '1600x1200', '1680x1050', '1920x1080', '1920x1200', '2560x1600'
