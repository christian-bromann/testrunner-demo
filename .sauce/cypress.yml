docker:
  # fileTransfer controls how test files are transferred to the docker container before tests are run (choice: mount|copy).
  # `mount` will mount files and folders into the container. Changes to these files and folders will be reflected on the
  # host as well (and vice versa). However, you may run into permission issues depending on your docker or host settings.
  # In this case the usage of `copy` is advised. `copy` will simply copy files and folders into the container.
  fileTransfer: mount # Defaults to `mount`. Choose between mount|copy.
